### What problems do you think exist in the current oracle? How does ares deal with these problems?

At present, Oracle mainly has the following problems: 
* high degree of centralization
* slow data response
* high handling charge 
* easy to attack.


The Oracle  in Ethereum ecology are faced with the problem of high gas fee, which leads to the inability to carry complex applications on the chain, which makes it impossible to add cryptography related algorithms to ensure the security of data on the chain. Without the blessing of algorithms, it is easy to be attacked by hackers. In addition, the frequency of submitting price updates is not too high, which can not guarantee the real-time performance of data. Ethereum produces a lot of problems The out of state band Oracle only implements the bidding node management similar to dpos, which can't manage a large number of bidding nodes and bring random bidding node management.


Ares is built on the basis of substrate. It uses babe consensus to ensure the anonymity of the quotation node, so that the evil nodes can not reach collusion, tamper with the price and decentralize the quotation node. It uses Polkadot's unique offchain Worker ensures that the data under the chain can be submitted to the chain safely and credibly, while babe consensus's powerful block out speed ensures the real-time submission of the price. It uses on chain governance to punish malicious bidding nodes, and rewards challengers to achieve the authenticity and reliability of the data on the chain.
